 link of bot : https://twitter.com/covid_retweet?lang=en
 
 The bot is ready, it retweets the tweets containing the below mentioned terms with a minimum of 5 retweets and 3 likes 

 Terms= "Verified" with any of these (Bed OR Blood OR Oxygen OR Fabiflu OR Plasma OR ICU OR Tocilizumab OR Ventilator 
				       OR Emergency OR Plasma OR donor OR verified OR needed OR available OR SOS)
 with or without a # it doesn't matter.

 If your tweet has the term "verified" with any of the above terms it will be retweeted.

 Hence we appreciate if u post verified info on twitter because there ain't any cyber cell which will verify the info being shared 

 It would be great if u delete the tweets once you get help so that those who are still in need can be focused and shortlisted
